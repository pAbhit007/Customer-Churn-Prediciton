# Customer-Churn-Prediciton
Churn prediction is a crucial application of machine learning that focuses on identifying customers or users who are likely to stop using a product or service. Churn, also known as customer attrition, occurs when customers discontinue their relationship with a business, whether it's canceling a subscription, ending a contract, or simply ceasing to use a service. Churn prediction models aim to forecast which customers are at a higher risk of churning so that businesses can take proactive measures to retain them.

#### Understanding the Objective:
First it's crucial to understand that our goal is to anticipate when customers may decide to cancel their subscription. This allows us to identify the reasons, behind their decision and make improvements to our service accordingly.

#### Collecting Data:
We gather information about our customers, such as their tenure with us the purposes for which they use our service and any previous interactions they've had with us.

#### Data Cleansing:
We carefully review and clean up the collected data ensuring that any errors or inconsistencies are eliminated. This step ensures the accuracy of our predictions.

#### Creating Key Features:
We select elements from the data that can aid in predicting whether a customer might churn. These factors could include frequency of service usage, satisfaction levels instances of contacting customer support or recent changes, in usage patterns.

#### Training a model:
Afterwards we utilize the sanitized and processed data to train a machine learning model. This model learns from patterns, within the data and endeavors to comprehend which factors are interconnected with customers decisions to either continue or discontinue their subscription. It's akin, to instructing a computer on how to identify indicators that someone may be contemplating canceling their subscription.

#### Validation and Testing:
Once the model has been trained it is crucial to assess its performance. To do so we evaluate its ability to predict whether customers will churn based on data that it hasn't encountered during the training phase.

#### Deployment and Monitoring:
Once our model is performing well, we put it to work. It starts analyzing new customer data to predict churn. We also keep an eye on it, regularly checking its predictions against real outcomes. If it's not performing as well as we want, we can adjust or update the model to make it better.

#### Taking Action:
When our model predicts that a customer might leave, we can take proactive action. This might involve reaching out to the customer, offering them special deals, or addressing their concerns to prevent them from leaving. By using the insights from our predictions, we can make our service better and keep more customers happy.

#### Continuous Improvement:
Churn prediction is an ongoing process. As we gather more data and learn from customer behaviors, we can refine our model and strategies. This helps us stay ahead of customer preferences and keep our churn rate low over time.
